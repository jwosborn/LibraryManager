# LibraryManager
An Application written in C# using .NET Core for the management of the Osborn Family Library.

I have utilized these features to meet the requirements for Code Louisville. 
1) Implement a master loop.
2) Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
3) Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
4) Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application


To Run the Application:
- Clone the repo.
- Open a terminal window and navigate to the cloned Directory and run this command:  ```$ dotnet run```
- Follow the onscreen prompts.
